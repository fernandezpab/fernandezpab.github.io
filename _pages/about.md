I am an Economist graduated from the [National University of Tucumán](https://face.unt.edu.ar/web/). I hold a **Master's degree in Economics** from the [University of San Andrés (UdeSA)](https://udesa.edu.ar/), where I am currently a **PhD candidate**. Additionally, I am completing a Master's in Econometrics at [Torcuato Di Tella University (UTDT)](https://www.utdt.edu/), combining robust theoretical training with advanced quantitative tools.

I specialize in **applied microeconomics**, with a central focus on the **impact evaluation** of public policies. Throughout my professional career, I have collaborated as a Research Assistant in top-tier international organizations, including the **Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)** and **CAF - Development Bank of Latin America**, as well as in academic research centers such as CELIV and Di Tella University.

My work is characterized by **econometric rigor** and the constant search for robust empirical evidence to support decision-making. I have participated in research addressing complex issues in areas such as labor markets, informality, crime, and economic development in Latin America.

I manage reproducible workflows using advanced statistical software (Stata, Python, R) and believe in the power of data to transform social reality.
