I am an Economist graduated from the [National University of Tucumán](https://face.unt.edu.ar/web/). [cite_start]I hold a **Master's degree in Economics** from the [University of San Andrés (UdeSA)](https://udesa.edu.ar/), where I am currently a **PhD candidate**[cite: 9, 13, 15]. [cite_start]Additionally, I am completing a Master's in Econometrics at [Torcuato Di Tella University (UTDT)](https://www.utdt.edu/), combining robust theoretical training with advanced quantitative tools[cite: 10, 11].

[cite_start]I specialize in **applied microeconomics**, with a central focus on the **impact evaluation** of public policies[cite: 43]. [cite_start]Throughout my professional career, I have collaborated as a Research Assistant in top-tier international organizations, including the **Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)** and **CAF - Development Bank of Latin America** [cite: 18][cite_start], as well as in academic research centers such as CELIV and Di Tella University[cite: 18].

My work is characterized by **econometric rigor** and the constant search for robust empirical evidence to support decision-making. [cite_start]I have participated in research addressing complex issues in areas such as labor markets, informality, crime, and economic development in Latin America[cite: 18, 43].

[cite_start]I manage reproducible workflows using advanced statistical software (Stata, Python, R) and believe in the power of data to transform social reality[cite: 40].
